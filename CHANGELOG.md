# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

Initial scaffold.

### Added
- `MultiplayerSession` — shared session bound to a Mastra thread, with a
  participant roster and audit ledger.
- `PresenceManager` — heartbeat-based presence with idle and drop windows,
  typing state, and background sweeping.
- `ApprovalGate` + policy engine — four-eyes, n-of-m quorum, role gating,
  argument-bound approvals, deny-is-final, deny-on-expiry.
- `TurnController` — `queue`, `debounce`, `batch`, `skip`, `preempt` modes for
  concurrent human input, with `AbortSignal` propagation.
- `EventBus` — sequenced per-session pub/sub with a bounded replay buffer.
- Attribution helpers — speaker labelling and roster system-prompt injection.
- `multiplayerRoutes()` — SSE stream plus join/leave/presence/messages/
  interrupt/approvals/audit endpoints for `registerApiRoute`.
- `MultiplayerClient` and `useMultiplayerSession` — browser client with
  reconnect-from-sequence, and a headless React hook.
- `InMemoryMultiplayerStore` for development and tests.

### Known gaps
- Single-process bus and store.
- Approval policies are not persisted across restarts.
- No CRDT/co-editing layer.
